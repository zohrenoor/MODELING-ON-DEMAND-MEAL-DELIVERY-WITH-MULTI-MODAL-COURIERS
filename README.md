# MODELING-ON-DEMAND-MEAL-DELIVERY-WITH-MULTI-MODAL-COURIERS
In this code, I developed a simulation optimization model for on-demand meal delivery challenges like dynamic routing, multiple courier modes, demand uncertainty, and bundling.

 We address the management of on-demand meal delivery operations within the context of uncertain demand. We develop a simulation optimization on-demand meal delivery model that optimizes the size of each mode and the spatial arrangement of the whole fleet. The simulation part of this model imitates the behavior of an integrated delivery system with multi-modal couriers and for multiple restaurants. The process of job assignment and consequently bundling is dynamically optimized in this system. In specific, a routing mathematical optimization model is embedded within the simulation model that dynamically determines the optimal route for each available courier upon the entry of a new order into the system. Choosing the best courier for a task is done based on the measures that are realized by the optimal routes. The model evaluates various factors, such as the current workload of each courier, load capacity of a courier, fuel consumption and refueling, the distance to the destination, and the estimated delivery time, etc. to identify the most suitable courier for the new task. It is worth mentioning that each delivery task undergoes optimization for assignment only once, and once it is assigned to a courier, that assignment remains unchanged. This configuration is designed to avoid convolution and prevent the anticipated excessive computational burden from becoming unmanageable. By leveraging the optimization model, we ensure that tasks are allocated in an efficient and effective manner, optimizing delivery routes and resource utilization.  

Note: 
Despite optimization efforts, the computational load remains substantial, as both the dual bound and the main problem must be solved for each customer-vehicle pair. For every new customer, the solver must re-optimize all vehicle routes. To address this, we used parallelization techniques, distributing the workload across multiple processors to achieve faster solution times. The effectiveness of parallelization increases with more processors, with optimal speed achieved when the number of processors matches the number of vehicles.
