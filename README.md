# MODELING-ON-DEMAND-MEAL-DELIVERY-WITH-MULTI-MODAL-COURIERS
In this code, I developed a simulation optimization model for on-demand meal delivery challenges like dynamic routing, multiple courier modes, demand uncertainty, and bundling.

We address the intricate challenges of on-demand meal delivery operations, including dynamic routing, multiple delivery courier modes, demand uncertainty, and bundling in an integrated delivery system. An advanced simulation optimization model is developed to incorporate all of these challenges and find the most efficient solution for them. By dynamically assigning delivery tasks to the most suitable courier based on factors such as workload, load capacity, and fuel consumption, the model optimizes delivery routes and resource utilization, ensuring efficient and effective service. Furthermore, the model has the potential to consider multiple delivery modes, such as electric vehicles, drones, conventional vehicles, and other types of courier modes, to improve operational efficiency, reduce costs, and minimize environmental impact. By integrating these innovative technologies into the model, a more sustainable and customer-centric approach to food delivery is promoted. Additionally, the model investigates the advantages of bundling orders and implementing an integrated delivery system for multiple restaurants. This strategy simplifies delivery logistics, improves coordination, and guarantees a consistent and high-quality service. Through analysis and the application of relevant models, this dissertation provides valuable insights and practical solutions for businesses in the food delivery industry to adapt to evolving market demands and maintain a competitive edge.
